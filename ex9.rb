# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.
#variable of a string
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
#variable of a string that starts a new line with each line
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

#printing out a string with the days variable
puts "Here are the days: #{days}"
#prints out the string with months variable
puts "Here are the months: #{months}"

#puts out a string in a quote block
puts %q{
  There's something going on here.
  With this weird quote
  We'll be able to type as much as we like.
  Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
}
